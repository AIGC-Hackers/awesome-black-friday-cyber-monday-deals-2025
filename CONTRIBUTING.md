If you're comfortable with Git:

1. Fork this repository
2. Edit README.md
3. Add your deal at the END of the appropriate category
4. Create PR with title: `Add [Your Product] - [Category]`

Format:
```markdown
|  🔥 | [Your Product](https://yoursite.com/black-friday) | One sentence description | 50% OFF with code **BF2025**. Valid Nov 20 - Dec 5, 2025 |
```

</details>

## Requirements

Your deal must meet ALL of these requirements:

### ✅ Must Have (Easy to Verify)

1. **Valid URL** - Link must be accessible and load properly
2. **Clear discount info** - Specific percentage/amount (e.g., "50% OFF", "$100 OFF")
3. **Valid dates** - Must include start and end dates for the 2025 Black Friday period (Nov-Dec 2025)
4. **Discount code** (if applicable) - Provide the actual code customers will use
5. **YOUR OWN product** - Must be your product/service, not someone else's

### ❌ NOT ALLOWED

- Blog posts or articles listing other companies' deals
- Affiliate links disguised as deals
- Aggregation pages with multiple products
- Referral schemes or MLM

**Note**: We don't require a dedicated Black Friday page - a pricing page with clear discount info is fine. As long as the discount, dates, and link are verifiable, you're good to go.
